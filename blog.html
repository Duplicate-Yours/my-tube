      <h1>Discuss the scope of `var`, `let`, and `const`.</h1>
      <p>
        In this article we have seen that var declarations are globally scoped
        or function scoped while let and const are block-scoped. var variables
        can be updated and re-declared within its scope; let variables can be
        updated but not re-declared; const variables can neither be updated nor
        re-declared. They are all hoisted to the top of their scope.

      <h1>Tell us the use cases of `null` and `undefined`</h1>
      <p>
        <b>Javascript Undefined:</b> If a variable is declared but the value is
        not assigned, then the value of that variable will be undefined. For
        example, It is also possible to explicitly assign undefined to a
        variable.<br />
        <b>Javascript Null:</b>
        In JavaScript, null is a special value that represents an empty or
        unknown value. For example, The code above suggests that the
        number variable is empty at the moment and may have a value later.

      <h1>What do you mean by REST API?</h1>
      <p>
        A REST API (Representational State Transfer Application Programming
        Interface) is an architectural approach for designing web services that
        are stateless, use standard HTTP methods (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE, etc.)
        to perform operations on resources identified by URLs, and follow a
        uniform and consistent interface for communication between clients and
        servers. It is a widely used method for building scalable and
        interoperable web-based systems.
